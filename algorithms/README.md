A list of interesting algorithms and data structures.

* [Gap Buffers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_buffer) are simpler than ropes and provide many similar benefits.
  - Of course, you could do a rope of gap buffers if you really wanted to.
* [Merkel DAG's](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/tree/master/merkledag) are a generalization of the Merkle Tree.
  - [IPLD](https://github.com/ipld/specs/blob/master/IPLD.md) has the updated version of the IPFS merkledag.
* [Merkle Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) store hierarchical, content-addressable data.
* [Piece Tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piece_table) represent a series of composable edits to an initial span of text.
