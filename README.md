# Tutorials

* [Amit](https://simblob.blogspot.com/) has a [great explanation of A* algorithm with visualizations](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html)
* [A great primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) on design of reliable, scalable systems.
* [Build your own X](https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x) for many values of X.
* [Aphyr](https://github.com/aphyr) (of [Jepsen](https://jepsen.io/) fame) teaches a class on distributed systems with [notes online](https://github.com/aphyr/distsys-class)
* [Jimmy Bogard](https://jimmybogard.com/) has a good multi-part series on [implementing resilient workflows](https://jimmybogard.com/refactoring-towards-resilience-a-primer/) when coordinating multiple services.
* Jimmy Bogard also has an interesting series on [resiliency built around loose coupling](https://jimmybogard.com/life-beyond-transactions-implementation-primer/).

# Free Stuff

* The [Textures Archive](http://www.grsites.com/archive/textures/) has a bunch of free background textures for building games, websites, apps, or just playing around.
* [Itch.io](https://itch.io/game-assets/free) has as large repository of free and low-cost graphics assets for games (mostly tile- and sprite-focused).
* [Scott Hanelman's](https://www.hanselman.com/) [tools list](https://hanselman.com/tools)

# Blogs

* [Ayende's blog](https://ayende.com/blog/) is a gold mine of information about developing professional software in C#, performance optimization, and concurrency.
* [Rands in Repose](http://randsinrepose.com/) for management tips in a software engineering context.
* [Fabulous Adventures in Coding](https://ericlippert.com/) is the blog of Eric Lippert, formerly of the C# compiler team. It's chock-full of static analysis goodness.
* [Jepsen](https://jepsen.io/) tracks behavior of databases against CAP theorem guarantees. Seeing detailed analysis of how systems break under pressure is super-informative about how hard distributed databases are.
